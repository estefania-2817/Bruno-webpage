        <p class="intro">Bruno, a magnificent Rottweiler, was born on December 4, 2020, and joined your family as a surprise from your mom. 
            It was on January 3, 2021, that your mom brought home this bundle of joy all the way from Arecibo, PR. 
            At just a few weeks old, Bruno embarked on a lifelong adventure filled with love, loyalty, and unforgettable moments. 
            This handsome fellow is larger than life, towering above you and tipping the scales at an impressive 105 pounds.</p>
        <p class="intro">His sleek black coat and distinctive Rottweiler features, including his dotted eyebrows, make him a striking presence wherever he goes. 
            One of Bruno's greatest joys in life is staying active. He absolutely adores running and engaging in lively tug-of-war sessions. 
            However, when he's in the mood for some relaxation, Bruno is a master cuddler. 
            His affectionate nature shines through, especially when he craves companionship or senses that his family has returned home.</p>

        <p class="intro">Bruno possesses an impressive range of tricks and skills, a testament to his intelligence and training. 
            From basic commands like sit, down, and paw, to more unique ones such as "calm down" and "excuse me," Bruno has mastered them all. 
            His sad face when you mention "I'm leaving" is both heartwarming and endearing, showcasing his emotional intelligence.</p>
        <p class="intro">While Bruno hasn't participated in any competitions or won awards, he has managed to carve out his own special place in your family's 
            heart with his charming antics. One of the most amusing memories involves his knack for food thievery. From chicken to bread to cake, Bruno's 
            mischievous exploits are bound to bring smiles and laughter to everyone's faces. And who could forget the time he got into an intense battle with 
            his own reflection in the mirror, resulting in a comical mishap?</p>

        <p class="intro">Like any hero, Bruno has conquered fears and overcome challenges. He conquered his fear of getting into your little car, a testament 
            to his bravery and determination. However, he remains a bit of a scaredy-cat when it comes to things larger than him or loud noises. Despite 
            these fears, Bruno's protective nature shines through, as he constantly watches over and loves his family unconditionally.</p>
